One thing that has always been difficult for me is learning concepts and being able to explain them in words.
I have always been good at math, and applying equations to solve problems in engineering, but it's hard for to verbalize what
is actually physically going on sometimes. So with coding and learning on my own, I don't have many opportunities
to speak about what's going on or even have to explain what I did or why or how I did something. It can be confusing when
trying to learn new things when you can't always remember what a method is or an object, but you just used them in your code and
you felt comfortable with it without really knowing that you already know what they are. It can also make googling for answers to problems
difficult when you don't know the proper terminology as well. I'm sure I'll get better with more exposure, but I want to start
making my own definitions for common terms to try to help them stick. With mechanical engineering, I have had to learn a lot about
injection molding by experience, and I had to overcome talking about parting lines and gates when I didn't 100% fully know everything
about them or even what they looked like at sometimes. Sometimes you just have to jump in and start talking, and if you say something
completely off base, someone will let you know. And usually I've found, no one makes fun of you for it either.
