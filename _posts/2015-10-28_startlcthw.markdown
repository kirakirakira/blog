I started "Learn C The Hard Way" and found this article basically discrediting most of the book: http://hentenaar.com/dont-learn-c-the-wrong-way.
I think I am going to have to be more diligent as I go through this book, and not take everything word for word. In the article, I was able to find the ISO standard for C,
 and it looked really handy. Even had some language I could understand. I wasn't expecting that from an ISO standard.
 
 So anyway, I think I'll start taking some notes, and cross-referencing material as I go along, and hopefully I have time to record it in this blog, so I can see how I 
 progress in my understanding.
 
 I've finished only the first two exercises, and now am stuck at trying to figure out what he means by "Run man 3 puts and read about this function and many others." in the 
 Extra Credit section. I am not getting any good Google results on that.
 
 Cheers!
