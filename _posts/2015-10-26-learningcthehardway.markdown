Yesterday I bought a physical copy of "Learn C The Hard Way" by Zed Shaw, and I am going to go through the exercises over the next 3 months.
It's really hard for me to stick with a book for some reason, I'm better with online classes with real deadlines. So I am going to map out a schedule here and try to stick with it.

<table class="tableizer-table">
<tr class="tableizer-firstrow"><th>Week</th><th>Monday's Date</th><th>Exercises</th></tr>
 <tr><td>1</td><td>10/26/2015</td><td>0, 1, 2, 3</td></tr>
 <tr><td>2</td><td>11/2/2015</td><td>4, 5, 6, 7</td></tr>
 <tr><td>3</td><td>11/9/2015</td><td>8, 9, 10, 11</td></tr>
 <tr><td>4</td><td>11/16/2015</td><td>12, 13, 14, 15</td></tr>
 <tr><td>5</td><td>11/23/2015</td><td>16, 17, 18, 19</td></tr>
 <tr><td>6</td><td>11/30/2015</td><td>20, 21, 22, 23</td></tr>
 <tr><td>7</td><td>12/7/2015</td><td>24, 25, 26, 27</td></tr>
