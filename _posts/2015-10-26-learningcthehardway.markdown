Yesterday I bought a physical copy of "Learn C The Hard Way" by Zed Shaw, and I am going to go through the exercises over the next 3 months.
It's really hard for me to stick with a book for some reason, I'm better with online classes with real deadlines. So I am going to map out a schedule here and try to stick with it.

| 1      |  10/26/2015    | 0, 1, 2, 3 |
| 2      |  11/2/2015     | 4, 5, 6, 7 |
