Yesterday I bought a physical copy of "Learn C The Hard Way" by Zed Shaw, and I am going to go through the exercises over the next 3 months.
It's really hard for me to stick with a book for some reason, I'm better with online classes with real deadlines. So I am going to map out a schedule here and try to stick with it.
