Just curious on how writing a blog post in github works. I don't know any markdown, so I think I should learn.

Things to do:
<ul>
  <li>Learn C</li>
  <li>Free Code Camp</li>
  <li>Coursera: Philosophy of Science</li>
  <li>NaNoWriMo in November!</li>
</ul>

So I originally totally forgot the header part that tells everything this is a post, so hopefully this now looks much improved.
