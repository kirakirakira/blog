Just curious on how writing a blog post in github works. I don't know any markdown, so I think I should learn.

Things to do:
+ Learn C
+ Free Code Camp
+ Coursera: Philosophy of Science
+ NaNoWriMo in November!

So I originally totally forgot the header part that tells everything this is a post, so hopefully this now looks much improved.
