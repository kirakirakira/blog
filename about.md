Hey everyone! I'm Kira, a mechanical engineer who wants to code (instead). I started Free Code Camp in August this year (2015) while I was searching for new software bootcamps. I'm really enjoying it so far, and am close to the Front-End Development Certificate. I hope to finish that by the end of year. CSS is by far one of the coolest things ever, and I wish we had used it back when I did Web Page Design class in high school in the early 2000s.

But to back up, my coding journey started fall of 2012 with the launch of edX, and my first MOOC class, Introduction to Computer Science and Programming by MIT, where we learned Python. It was an incredibly hard class. My last programming experience was using Matlab for my ME classes. I worked really hard at the class and was really proud when I passed. I then went on to take many more programming courses, many of them on Coursera. However, I felt like I was getting to a point where I knew enough, and really needed to start doing something more practical andn useful with my skills. That's also what lead me to Free Code Camp and learning about web development. It's something I can build easily on my own while I learn.

I'm also starting to learn to code in C. We'll see how that goes. I think it will be bit more of a challenge than learning Python and Javascript... :)
